# Improve and Grow Auditability

How to make the auditing process of funded proposals efficient, distributed and transparent?

Fund Size: **$100,000 in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26119) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26119/stage/unspecified).

# Networks of trust & reputation

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Networks-of-trust-reputation/365777-48088)

Proposer: Stephen Whitenstall

informal networks risk introducing unwarranted assessments of trust and reputation. Community assessments & the decisions of voters may rest merely on past associations. After a few funding rounds informal networks may begin to establish themselves as a permissioned culture that draws on a permissionless chain.

# Access to and use of fund data

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Access-to-and-use-of-fund-data/365775-48088)

Proposer: Stephen Whitenstall

Just providing access to Fund data is not sufficient for auditability. Careful analysis is required of how a proposal's budget is spent and what stages have been achieved. It is also necessary to communicate the state of a funded proposal as widely as possible and in an accessible, consistent format.

# Matching quality approach of IOHK

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Matching-quality-approach-of-IOHK/365773-48088)

Proposer: Stephen Whitenstall

The bar of quality in Project Catalyst needs to be raised to a level of maturity that ultimately matches the quality approach of IOHK with its peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods. A high level of quality assurance must become integral to the success and reputation of a funded proposal.

# Distributed Auditability

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Auditability/365770-48088)

Proposer: Stephen Whitenstall

Meeting the challenge to improve and grow auditability requires a distributed approach. An effective & equitable distribution of auditability will require connections between the funded proposer & the community to be established, the communal development of transparent audit methods & constant iteration.

# Challenge Team support

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Challenge-Team-support/365574-48088)

With the introduction of the Challenge Teams and their role in auditing this challenge could be expanded too include more specifically porposals that support Challenge Teams. This could include tooling or budgets for teams too go beyond the role description, developing models for auditing specific challenges.

## Additional Comment

This audibility challenge may also inform how Challenge Teams should be structured. Such as including some input from those who supported and voted for the presentation of the challenge. This would ameliorate the risk of introducing a Challenge "closed shop". There is massive potential in Challenge Teams leading by example. By making it desirable to demonstrate quality, by distributing knowledge and expertise.

# Isn't this problem being tackled?

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Isn-s-this-problem-being-tackled/365199-48088)

In Fund5 [this project was funded](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350699-48088). From what I understood this problem is already being worked on.
