## Introduction

Project Catalyst is the beginning of bringing on-chain governance to Cardano. It is a series of experiments which leverage the collective intelligence of the Catalyst community to determine the future direction and development of the Cardano ecosystem. Through a series of ‘innovation funds’, the community sources brilliant ideas, decided via a vote, and the Treasury finances the best ideas for building a global blockchain.

This repository contains the work of the Eastern Hemisphere community (CE ETH) proposal work. The C3 ETH  is helping enable community members from a wide variety of countries and languages in the eastern timezones. A particular focus of the team is to localise Cardano Catalyst content and on-baording to enable the widest participation possible.
### Why Collaborate?

Collectivily the Cardano Community is puting a great deal of time, effort, and passion into creating a governance system which allows everyone to have their voice heard. The aim is to:

- Distributed research and development. We can build things better, faster, and cheaper than top down organizations when we empower our community.

- Decentralized team building. Great innovation comes from great teams. Many of our most impactful projects come from teams who met while becoming a part of Project Catalyst.

- Group refinement and execution. We see a significant improvement in the quality of proposals after the community weighs in with their constructive criticism.

Contributions of any kind welcome!
## Current Status

We are current in the insight phase (week one) of the Catalyst process. Please add your challenge insights and there project catalyst link to the `insights.md` file in the challenge folder.

## Proposal Development Process

We will be developing proposals for two areas:

1. C3 ETH Specific Proposals to help with our goals
2. Language specific Challenge Settings.

Fund 7 Challenge Setting Proposal(s) are Language-specific challenges while the C3 ETH proposals are specific to our team's efforts, or to helping with multilingual support in general.

We will be putting up multiple proposals. This is to help us learn and see what peoples preferences are. When we notice other communities suggesting similar proposals we will seek to collaborate and merge effors. Catalyst is non-rivalous, we all win by working together.

During the insight phase, collaborators are asked to submit their insights to [Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) and then add their insight plus link to the Project Catalyst submission into the `insight.md` of the challenge in this repositiory.

Anyone who wants to draft insights this week should. We encourage everyone to draft insights to raise our profile and receive feedback. We will use these insights and any community comments to help us develop our proposals.

Some ideas already sugguested include:

- A fund to act as a bounty for translation of proposals
- Local Community centers proposal
### Mapping Proposals

To ensure the various communities- Catalyst Swarm, School, and ETH don't compete are map of the proposals is maintained on the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l2_uFQI=/).
### Translation Process

Our intention is all proposals will be fully translated into languages from the eastern hemisphere. The aim is to enable the widest possible inclusion into the Catalyst process. **Return on Intention** is international participation. To stream line the translation of all the proposals we will be using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/c3eth-fund6) to automate the process.

**CONTRIBUTING TO TRANSLATIONS:** You can contribute to translations by signing up to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/c3eth-fund6) and begin translating the content listed in the project. c3eth team members will check over your translations and approve them or offer improvements. The translations will be pulled into the `I10n_main` branch of this repository and periodically merged into `main`.

This workflow will be extended to include the translation of the website content and and videos we produce.

Direct translation using a text editor and git also possible for contributors that are comformatable with using git, GitHub, and Markdown.
