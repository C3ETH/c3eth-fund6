Many intermediates result in lack of transparency how funds actually impacted the borrower cash flow situation. Creating traceability and transparency could take micro finance to the next level and help to get the impacts it aim to achieve.

# Code is NOT Law

There is an often repeated maximin in the blockchain space that "Code is Law." At best smart contracts and the supporting infrastructure encode aspects of rules, aspects of the law. If the actions of code are in any way interacting with the outside world, then a legal context wraps their use. How can we bind legal intent to smart contracts and transactions using meta-data? 

 Ian Griggs defined the Ricardian Contracts to do this. Can we build Ricardian Contract tools for Cardano?
