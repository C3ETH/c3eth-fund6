# $700 Billion Remittance Market

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/$700-Billion-Remittance-Market/365825-48088)

Proposer: Greg Bell

A few months ago ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood talked about Cryptocurrency usage in the remittance market.

She identified a lot of funds that the remittance market is dropping due to excessive charges. She additionally noted that there are nations whose GDP largely depends on remittances. Wood gave the examples of Tonga and El Salvador. For Tonga, 30% of their GDP.  A Bitcoin-based cost gateway might save as much as $40 billion. That exceeds their U.S. assist finances.

# Numbers that get reported

Proposer: Greg Bell

It doesn't take much perusing of headlines to realize that some numbers attract interest and attention more than others.  Are you more interested in  headline that reads "$550k"  or "Half a million $".   When you're bombarded by information all day, would you even bother reading about a pool of $150K for some project types?

Big broad challenges with big budgets and wide appeal will get Cardano reported on and talked about.

# Six(?) degrees of separation

Proposer: Greg Bell

Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people on average are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other.

The reality is that there are some people with many and distant links that are significant connectors of disparate or distant social groups.  Challenges that cater to groups where there are high numbers of these individuals (e.g. remittances) will help to globalize Cardano and encourage its mass adoption.

# Innovation without restraints

Proposer: Greg Bell

Imagine the frustration you would feel if you got enthused about your great idea for Cardano and decided to try using Catalyst to get it off the ground, only to find that there isn't a category that it fits into.

If we are to be truly innovative, we need a challenge (preferably on an ongoing basis) that allows proposals that are thinking outside the current funding round's boxes.
