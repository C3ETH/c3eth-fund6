# Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano

## Câu hỏi thách thức:
How do we grow the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia in an inclusive, diverse and supportive way? The same way we do in Africa, focused initiatives and implementations!

## Why is it important?
The Cardano community is heavily based in North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.

## How does success look like?
A wide spectrum of people from Asia or with connections to Asia coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.

## Key Metrics to measure

The quantity and quality of funded proposals as well as the impact observed.

A steady increase in SPOs and transactions in East Asia.

## Challenge brief

As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain technology and the Cardano protocol should be a priority for the Catalyst community. Providing the funding for those people who learn about our protocol to take advantage of the protocol and the support the community offers seems to me to be why we work together, doesn't it?

The overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally funds people around the world.

Addressing these different parts of the world directly through funding challenges such as this gives them access to our community and thereby a means of support as they engage with the Cardano ecosystem.

The amount of funding which is proposed equals 6.25 % of the total available for Fund 7. The suggestion is that this is a nice percentage to use as a guide for future rounds when funding increases for all of the challenges that focus on specific regions.

## What this is:

A call to activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, risk and reward this opportunity to make the world a better place.

## What this is not:

This is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed. All that is required is the equal opportunity to succeed or fail that many of the rest of us enjoy, but with their hinderances and hurdles lessened and their choices remaining in their own hands.

## Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails:

I have had my eyes opened and my mind changed about the potential of South-East Asia. From South-East Asia's bankers in the west, ex-pats with vision and heart, youth with passions, documentaries that challenged my assumptions and Cardano community members with so much to give.

Thank you to all of you who have commented and interacted with me over the last few weeks.

## Impact

**Impact**: Fund5 will get underway shortly after the Ethiopian government deal is likely to have been announced and will build on its momentum. Along with this major announcement, South-East Asia has more underutilised talent than this proposal can possibly support but it has unlimited potential to uncover them and get them seen around the world. It is the right time for this community challenge to change the world with maximum effect.

**Feasibility**: South-East Asia is poised for technology focussed growth (see video above), has over 600 technology hubs spread across the continent and is home to 4 of the top 20 fastest growing economies in the world.

**Auditability**: Like all community proposals it relies on the results of the challenge it proposes to truly prove itself, but the metrics it proposes could give an early indication of how successful it is.

**Budget**: Large enough to attract attention and significant proposals, but small enough to allow other community proposals to seek funding
