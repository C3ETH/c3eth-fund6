# Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs

How do we encourage Local Community Hubs to drive adoption and awareness of Cardano in the next 6 months?

Fund Size: **$100,000 in Ada**

# Preservation of Culture / Textiles

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Preservation-of-Culture-Textiles/365217-48088)

Proposer: Ricky

With the exponentially growing environmental and ethical effects of fast fashion and with Cultural Textiles on the decline, are we able to structure a Global Initiative to support community/local artisans in textiles for the preservation and development of their culture?

My initial thoughts was to start a DAO connecting all participating parties and developing a digital market place for their goods to be sold.

# Cardano Vietnam Official Group

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Vietnam-Official-Group/365308-48088)

I'm Cuong-one of the Admins from Cardano Vietnam Official Group-the first Cardano Community in Vietnam since 2017 with nearly 2000 members. We've been translating information/documents... related to Cardano such as Catalyst Project,IOHK's blog,Cardano Foundation's vision...into Vietnamese. With the desire to spread Cardano and contribute to the growth of the Cardano community around the world,we're willing to become an official "bridge" between the Cardano Family

# VILAI-X COMMUNITY

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/VILAI-X-COMMUNITY/365814-48088)

We would love to build a strong Cardano Community at Vietnam and South East Asia by helping them to become a better version via training & healing. Starting at Vietnam via following activities:

1. Setup a healing & training center at Vienam.

2. Do free-training to all members to stay strong in body, mind and spirit. We also do healing, coaching, meditation training...etc.

3. Update all knowledge about Cardano eco-system and give help to guide them in regards to executing smart contract.

# Decentralised Implementation

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Decentralised-Implementation/364929-48088)

Advancement of technology often leaves many community organisations behind. My insight to encourage Local Community Hub's to drive adoption and awareness to Cardano is to help facilitate Decentralised Systems and Structures within their already existing organisation to bridge the gap between them and technological advancements.

The innovation comes in providing suitable solutions for these organisations to easily adapt to the Cardano Landscape from small projects to hybrid business structures.

# Multilanguage support for cnfthub

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Multilanguage-support-for-cnfthub/365450-48088)

The CNFT Hub (cnfthub.io) was built with one distinct purpose; to give a voice to all projects, regardless of who stands to gain from them.  Since Cardano is a worldwide platform, we would like to expand upon CNFTHub.io by adding more languages to the site, to allow users to read in their native language.  This will require a team of people who can translate from English to these other world languages.  We would start with Spanish, and then work to add more over time.

# How we make it useful for them!

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/How-we-make-it-useful-for-them!/365551-48088)

When we try to explain this blockchain world to new people some times is hard and complicated for them and us... But why don't we focus on finding ways to make useful cases of how can people benefit from using ADA, and the hubs will be created around those uses!

I've been working on a Crypto concept that will increase and innovate on the way people interchange their work time being able and available to help each other and collaborate throw the use of the Cardano blockchain.

## Additional Comment

This use is being discussed a lot in various groups. Two tools, in particular, are mentioned:

- [coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)
- [Source Cred](https://sourcecred.io/)

It is a real need that we've experienced in develop the Venture Centre, hence the reference to an invisible economy in the [Venture Activation Proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Local-Venture-Activation-Centres/340143-48088)

"Wallet and backend analytical tools to help coordinate and account for the collaborations in the invisible economy. To help scale the Cardano Venture Activation Centres operations and reduce the burden of running one, we need tools to help us."

# Information Hub For All Users

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Information-Hub-For-All-Users/366254-48088)

We need an easily readable and translatable resource for the Cardano ecosystem that is useful to both new and veteran users; an intuitive and easily navigable map cataloging the Cardano ecosystem.

This dynamic and searchable website will contain short, informative blurbs, written in layman's terms, describing each industry. This will be supplemented by a library of definitions of terms used. Each project has an unbiased, informative write-up covering what it offers to users (builtoncardano.com)
