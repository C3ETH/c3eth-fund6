## 詳細プラン(必須ではありません) - 詳細を記入してください

The Eastern Townhall is a community-driven initiative growing Cardano in the Eastern Hemisphere and across Asia. We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:

* We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.
* Language and culture are not an barrier to participation.
* We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.
* Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.
* Enrich Cardano's ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.

The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.

### Current Problems and Limitation

The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.

### The Team

**TODO: Include** [Team Bio](https://hackmd.io/@c3eth-team/HkgAw-wWY/edit)

The team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall **trusted seed**. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm[1], and Catalyst School[3] and other community groups across Asia.

### Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds

To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.

We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:

* We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.
* We host different events where community members come together
* We bridges to underrepresented groups
* We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and
* We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.

**We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.**

Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.

This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.

Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed ondemand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.

In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.

Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.

Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.

## Discussion Notes

The proposal is about managing a pool of funds ($10K USD) to help fund the work of the Eastern Townhall.

ETH is not funded, and we need support funding support! We hope to develop a set of communities who host events that provides service to the Eastern Hemisphere.

Simply put this proposal is about Organising Eastern Halls. Establishing a resource a distributed support structure that provides the positions and funds needed. So setup a treasury and reporting approach around how the funds a distributed. A pool of funds for the Eastern Townhall whose use is reported back to the Catalyst community tranparently

The intent of the proposal is essentially about prototyping DAO treasury management[1].

In the proposal, we are asking the community to give us $10K USD to spend at our discretion. On expenses like offering translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD; paying for activities related to organising the eastern town hall.

In return, we promise to report back our activities and expenses regularly. This is typical for all funded projects but I think we lead here.

We will need to produce a monthly report. Similar in intent to the work being done by index.coop[2] and FWB[3].

> How do we manage the money? What deserves treasury spending and what doesn’t? How should we diversify the treasury’s assets? Should we borrow capital?
> 
> Most DAOs are still figuring this out. The best practices are being written. We’re all exploring this new frontier together.

Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract more funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us. Help us scale and reach more people.
