# Catalyst value onboarding

How can we encourage meaningful participation in Project Catalyst from community members in the next two funds?

Fund Size: **$75,000 in Ada**

# How can I help?

The information for new commers is overwhelming, although they join as they feel connected to the community goals and vision. What about creating a simple engine the connect between tasks to do and how people can help? For example:
- A community member can dedicate x hours per week and he/she has an experience with mentoring start-ups – will match with CA tasks. Or
- A social network influencer about new tech with 200k followers – can match and promote some of the applications

# Incentivizing Interaction

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3069540-48088?)

Growing amount of research highlight the importance of interactions among people from different backgrounds in bringing about innovations. Cardano's lofty goals have attracted people from diverse background who share a simple goal: to make the world a better place. Yet, Cardanians still remain a herd of cats: doing their own things. Cardano's culture could be a fertile ground for greater innovations should interactions be incentivised, and their contribution duly recognised and amply rewarded.

# Marketing Budget For Proposals

There should be an ADA marketing budget tied to all proposals that make it to voting. This can be used to spread the information around, at a much higher scale, to anyone who could be a potential voter. I have a lot of ideas on this if anyone wished to discuss.
