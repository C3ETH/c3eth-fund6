# Proposer outreach

How can we encourage entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds?

Fund Size: **$100,000 in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26105) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26105/stage/unspecified).

# Collaboration with tech Incubators

One idea could be to look for the platforms available today for entrepreneurs and collaborate with them. The entrepreneurs might be already working on some related projects to the fund challenges and connecting it to Catalyst will be a win win.

In addition, the incubators rejects most projects which are not ready but could already be great proposals and with great teams already in place.

We have to do better at reviewing proposals earlier. [Check the assessments](https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/fund/f5/challenge/25945/proposals/352712). Here's [a link to the proposal](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/352712-48088) so you don't have to click around too much.

## Additional Comments

Are we ready for entrepreneurs to enter Catalyst? It's difficult to for start ups to allocate the time that Catalyst requires. Promptous has 385 followers on LinkedIn. The founders have thousands of connections individually. That may not seem like much, but that's either other start ups, insurance companies, and that's just LinkedIn. 

Perhaps we should look at the network effect of a startup that receives votes and how broad their network is in order to get a better measure on the impact a proposal could have.
Perhaps the intangibles deserve a little more research.

# The promise Land of Proposers

In every country we have bright minds that still doesn't know about ADA, the Catalyst Project and the opportunities it represent. But what about the Spanish Speaking community that has over 20 countries and more that 500 million people? 

I've been a part of the start up ecosystem in this region and still not even 1% of the people is aware of all this. Making them know, creating content and events for this segment will attract an enormous amount of minds and hearts that will add a lot of value!

# Cardano Romania Business Club

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Romania-Business-Club/365480-48088)

My idea is to create Cardano Romania Business Club (CRBC) and through meetings and knowledge sharing with examples to encourage romanian entrepreneurs who haven't been involved into crypto to embrace the new Cardano ecosystem and join new and innovative business models.

# Best business incubators

When searching for "best business incubators in Australia", you get a pretty vibrant list of business incubators. I wonder how many know about Catalyst? Could they become "Offical Catalyst Partners". As an Entrepenuer I'm not sure Catalyst funding is going to meet my entire business needs, I'm not even sure it is going to support me start and run my business. I think I need more support, financial and expertise than just a grant from Catalyst.
