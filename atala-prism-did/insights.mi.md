Make it easier for membership organisations and indigenous peoples to onboard members. Help them create non-government credentials under their control. Such tools become the basis for developing an economic identity for these legal entities.

Examples include giving community members the tools needed to educate, help and onboard others in their community. Initial non-government credentials verified, can assert membership to a savings group, or being a member of a tribe.

## Additional Comments

Making it easier for grassroots membership organisations and indigenous groups to onboard members and help them create a digital identity that is under their control will lead to increased adoption of Cardano-based DApps and be the basis for developing an economic identity for these NGOs, social organisations and indigenous cultures.

Giving community members the tools needed to educate, help and onboard others in their community to set up digital identities easily. Individuals are able to get a Cardano (Atala Prism) based digital identity set-up and initial non-government credentials verified, such as belonging to a savings group, being a member of a tribe.

Charities, Governments agencies, employers or tribes can easily establish and produce individual claims and issue them to individuals.

Indigenous organisations in particular such as tribal trusts and companies are able to integrate with Cardano's DiD based framework and enable better communication with their members.

An outline of the needs and community lead approach for designing membership registers for Māori organisations in Aotearoa (NZ) can be found in the document A Rōpū Tīkanga Māori Membership Database Toolkit (see attached PDF https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/idea/341410/35461/download ).

What would such a toolkit be if incorporated Self-Sovereign Identity perspectives? Consider for instance developing indigenous trust frameworks that focus on the sharing and reuse of data. For instance in conjunction with [Te Mana Raraunga (Māori Data Sovereignty)](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/)
