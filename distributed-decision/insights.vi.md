Building from the research being conducted under the Fund 4 funding, Photrek is seeking to expand the community participation in the research and development of voting protocols that balance the risks and opportunities for decentralized governance. A key question is how can we forecast the tradeoffs between stakeholder influence, community engagement, and representative experts. If you have interest in being directly engaged with this R&D effort we'd like to hear from you. Send us a message.
