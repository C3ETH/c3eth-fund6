# Proposal Title

Connecting Asian Voters & Proposers

## Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

Voting on how Catalyst spends the treasury creates long-term value to ADA, but with so many proposals, with so many new concepts, how do we make any voting decision? Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.

### Current Problems and Limitation

Language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.

Misaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- "I didn't understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly". The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues.

### The Team

**TODO: Include** [Team Bio](https://hackmd.io/@c3eth-team/HkgAw-wWY/edit)

The team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall **trusted seed**. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm[1], and Catalyst School[3] and other community groups across Asia.

### Proposed solution: Eastern Townhall Goverance Forum

Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:

1. Content production: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.
2. Eastern Hemisphere Language-specific events focused on voter education and discussion.
3. A proposal language translation pipeline to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community.
4. Language-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust.
5. Social Media Marketing: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and
6. Conduct routine surveys and user research to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats.

The proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.

Together these activities form a programme we call the Eastern Townhall Forum. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.

The Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance **Yuta Yuta** recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community that this proposal draws. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.

Help us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.

## Discussion Notes

Voting gives ADA value but with so many proposals how do we make better voting decisions?

The intent of this proposal is to help with voter and proposer on-boarding. Proposing, gathering support, understanding the proposals & voting. Not about bringing more people into the system.

* Focused on voters and the factors that inhibit voting.
* An Educational process helps people making better decisions.
* While narrowing the gap between proposers and voters.
* Help establish trust between voters and proposals.
* The biggest barrier is the language.

Low/broken incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting but in Asia language barriers compound this. Asians face language barriers at every Catalyst stage, many vote randomly. Survey results show Japanese cast 30% of their votes randomly. This is due to a lack of quality education in familiar languages.

* There is also a Lack of incentive to vote.
* What are the incentives for voting?
* Awareness of who is involved and what is at stake is an incentive.

The constant experimentation of Catalyst requires a dynamic response from different languages and cultures to avoid one culture dominating the narrative. Collectivily language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents goverance initiatives from scaling globally.

The Eastern Townhall is an education process, a platform for others to help community make better decisions. Informing & Educating Asian Voters.

### Factors prohibiting voting?

- What are the inentives for voting. Why should I vote!
- Unfriendly UI and language barriers pushes users to randomly vote on proposals with the highest ratings only or not vote at all.
- The reasons for non-voting are almost incomprehensible ⇨ Lack of procedural explanation.
-  In Asia, 30% of the voters vote randomly ⇨ Lack of importance explanation in a familiar language.
- Didn't know how to be informed about their vote.
- Scams. Establishing trust between proposals and voters.

### Things to do.

- Understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.
- Develop awareness of proposals with voters.
- How-To-Vote Infographics for locals
- Grow the Asian Catalyst community using documents, infographics, meetings and social channels presented in Asian languages
- A simple and detailed infographics from start to finish on how-to-vote accomodating various socmed formats.
- Eastern Hemisphere Catalyst Meet-Up. Held 4 times with participation from Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam. Experienced members.
- Meet-up to convey the importance and procedure of Catalyst from various perspectives in a familiar language.
- East Asian Voter Discussion Event
