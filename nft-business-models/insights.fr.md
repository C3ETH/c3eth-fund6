# Auditability of NFT Business models

Proposer: Stephen Whitenstall

NFT Business models need to assure their customers of their own quality, reliance, robustness, & track-record. To achieve this any proposal in this challenge should be ready to demonstrate: a transparent legal status, a clear commitment to Cardano values (as the blockchain of choice) of connectedness, transparency & fairness, a well-documented, maintained and tracked system of governance and an unambiguous apportion of intellectual property so that clients & customers know their data is safe.

# NFT - Proof of Social Good Resource

Utilize NFTs as a reciept/badge for donations and participation within various communities and NGOs committed to blockchain growth. Some models can allow for NFT weighted governance within select community, i.e., a decentralized lobbying fund. These NFTs could then be pooled together, either as a whole or as sub-pools, and utilized as a resource for block validation.

Cardano is well positioned as a change agent already. This NFT model shines a light on that and provides more engagement overall

## Additional Comment

This is a great idea - and similar to what I'm planning for renewable energy development, i.e., it allows for participants, whether they are individuals, corporations or other non-profit organizations to show their commitment to a cause by purchasing various tiers of NFTs with ADA or a token based on the blockchain.  Of course, the added benefit would be validation/verification of the donor so that NGOs with a legitimate purpose can thrive by attracting donors with a legitimate commitment to the proposed cause. What this does is remove the "art" aspect from the NFT to some extent (obviously some of the NFTs sold may still be art), and provides a direct donor to impact chain.
