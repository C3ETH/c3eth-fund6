# Achieving Cardano Epiphany

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Achieving-Cardano-Epiphany/364964-48088)

Entrepreneurship requires a complex balance between Product and Customer Development. Each stage of a start-up companies growth requires a willingness to define clear hypotheses about the customer value of your proposed product, and the courage to engage with customers in conversations and activities that test the validity of your hypotheses. The Cardano community should develop an entrepreneur case-study program modeled on "Four Steps to Epiphany" by Steve Blank and NSF's I-Corp program

# Community Portfolio Management

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Community-Portfolio-Management/365230-48088)

Doing the right things with precious community-money and doing these things right can benefit from a well-thought Community Portfolio Management. This could be done by providing a systematic overview of preferred application clusters (showing what's already there, showing cooperation- respectively new opportunities - maybe in COIN360 cluster-style). Behind these application clusters could be repetitive community challenges for securing stable long-term investment into promising areas.

# Visual Work Routines

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Work-Routines/365546-48088)

A routine is a service or procedure that guides the implementation of a particular goal. Now imagine that routines can be visualized as a flowchart. If a routine is created for entrepreneurs to execute their solutions, then they can better understand the entire process, before submitting a proposal. Additionally, working towards creating such a broad routine would bring attention to complicated or incomplete subroutines, which could then be turned into their own proposals.

## Additional Comments

As a Creative Producer i found that some sort of templates can help people and teams express better their ideas, trying to simplify their entire process explanations into a language that will fit better the listeners and audiences.

I find your idea very interesting in that sense, those templates can be visual "stations" of different parts of the process. Trying to help the teams to better summarized their ideas, leaving behind the complicated terminology that might not resonate and grab the attention of voter and community

I agree that such a system could not only help proposers, but also voters. Being able to visualize how the components of a proposal fit together would be a great tool for voters to quickly digest an overview of the proposal, without having to read a wall of text.

# Don't reinvent the wheel

No need to reinvent the wheel here. Everyone else has done a great job at providing resources for entrepreneurs we just need to collect them all into a nice organised reference list. Just checkout the resources Kickstarter provides to creatives that want to launch a crowdfunding project. [Kickstarter Handbook](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook)

Nearly every crowdfunding site has a bucket load of useful resources on how to pitch your idea to a crowdfund community.

# Proposer 2 Mentor Platform

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Proposer-2-Mentor-Platform/366256-48088)

Many proposers have great ideas that can certainly drive a lot of impact for the Cardano's Ecosystem and the world. The issue is that most doesn't have all the skills and knowledge to produce proposals that are clear on their statement, plan and feasibility

By creating a platform that can matches proposers in seek of help with specialized and willing to help mentors, we can drive the creation of higher value, viable proposals that community can really vote to get them funded and make them real.
