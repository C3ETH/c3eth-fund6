# Developer ecosystem

How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?

Fund Size: **$1,005,000 in Ada**

# Language specific challenges

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Language-specific-challenges/366092-48088)

Proposer: Greg Bell

To take Catalyst and Cardano global, we need to establish a model and growth path for the adoption of new language groups and proposals that are in that language.  To get of the ground they will need voters, proposers and CAs that can use that language and ideally translate to/from the language.

If there is a suggested path for adoption and growth, then the language community has a roadmap that they can adopt or adapt.

# Introducing Catalyst Swarm

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Introducing-Catalyst-Swarm/365894-48088)

Hello and happy Fund6 everyone. We are a self-organizing Project Catalyst community, supporting the success of Cardano's Project Catalyst and its community of voters, advisors, proposers, SPO's, projects & groups.

We facilitate the After Town Halls, weekly Saturday Swarm Sessions, currently running Hackathon & the Idea fest.How can we improve and include more people from the community? Start a conversation with us. To find out more â€“ check out ["What is Swarm?"](https://tinyurl.com/buw6e5t5)


# Getting Started Training Lessons

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Getting-Started-Training-Lessons/366046-48088)

I think that in order to get developers both within and outsiders to hiy the ground down and running with their businesses, there should be a tool or feature directing and equipping them with all the awesome features and resources in the cardano ecosystem especially for developers. I think that it will bring them to speed with everything, developers and shortened the learning curve especially for new developers from other ecosystem.

# Ranking projects built on cardano

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Ranking-projects-built-on-cardano/365602-48088)

As a cardano believer, I would strongly like to invest on good projects being built on cardano. The problem is the I have hard time finding these projects.

My solution is to build a decentralised system that allows users to add cardano projects. These projects will be rank according to factors such as use cases, tokenomics, team and more.  This will give the investors the chance to be early on good projects, and also allow good projects to raise capitals other than catalyst.

# Use-Case Driven End-to-End Tutorial

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Use-Case-Driven-End-to-End-Tutorial/365680-48088)

The current suite of Cardano tutorials are very piecemeal.  Having taught developer training for many years, they need to be given a non-trivial use case (like "Mint an NFT") and then walked through it step by step to actually create a simple NFT on the test net.  A "playground" is good but insufficient to really understand how the architecture operates in production.  There are some good 'soup to nuts' solidity/ethereum tutorials on youtube that we can emulate.

## Additional Comments

This is the idea behind [A Smart Market Toolkit for Cardano](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/A-Smart-Market-Toolkit-for-Cardano/323408-48088) in Fund2 where Toolkit was both tutorial (the horizontal work) and a bunch of code/documentation (deep vertical) on how to develop for Cardano. The use case was non-trivial in implementation but trivial in scenario (trading cards and NFTs).

The proposal was too early for the community and the ask was too much; no one had heard of NFTs, eUTXO, nor much about smart contracts so the trading-card scenario seemed too trivial. The community still doesn't know much about token engineering, wider application of oracle pools, or different types of Auction protocols for price discovery of NFTs.

The point of the proposal was to help educate the community and the developer base. Making it a resource that could be built upon. I'm still undecided when it should be reintroduced into a Catalyst Fund.

# Community college ADA programs

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/community-college-ADA-programs/365143-48088)

Funding community college ADA programs at small community colleges traditionally attended by young people who may have talent but don't have the socioeconomic status required to afford a prestigious university would be a great way to introduce potential dev's to the ecosystem who may have immense potential to innovate in the ADA space but never had access to the resources to to pursue their ideas. I have yet to hear of IOHK Funding or partnering with any small colleges just big well funded ones
