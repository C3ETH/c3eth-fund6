## 詳細プラン(必須ではありません) - 詳細を記入してください

East Asia and Southeast Asia region unites culturally and linguistically diverse countries. People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a poplutation of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions.

### Current Problems and Limitation

Across East Asia and Southeast Asian regions english is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used [1].

Language barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our engergy, and our pespectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.

### The Team

**TODO: Include** [Team Bio](https://hackmd.io/@c3eth-team/HkgAw-wWY/edit)

### Proposed Solution: Translation Pipeline and Automation

Our objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start the development of localised content. We have already set up a simple translation pipeline[2] using Git, Github, and Crowdin[3] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.

Our initial objective is to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using this system. Gaining experience and building community.

We will start to embrace and adapt the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[4] to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take.

To get true scale, translations and localisation standards and automation need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano, the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work and learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages NFTs, Native Assets, and Metadata with Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach.

Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups in Cardano and Catalyst.

We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, then share them widely. Everything we learn and do we hope will inform and be informed by Cardano Ecosystem at large.

TODO: Budget, KPIs and Additional Details to be added.
