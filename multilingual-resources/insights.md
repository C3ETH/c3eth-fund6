# Insights for Multilingual resources

How can we motivate non english speakers to learn and grow Cardano ecosystem in the next 3-6 months?

Fund Size: **$75,000 in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26111) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26111/stage/unspecified).

# Motivating the Translators

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Motivating-the-Translators/365242-48088)

I think this is a very good challenge theme, but the challenge should not focus on the Topic: **"How does we motive non-english Speakers to learn about Cardano and grow the community"**. The answer to this is to easy, we give them the needed content in their local language.

We should focus more on: **"How does we motivate the Translators to provide needed content for the non-english speakers."** With this focus we achieve a more sustainable solution for the future. Maybe we change the brief to this?

# Coordination between proposers

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Coordination-between-proposers/365262-48088)

It is possible that for this challenge a lot of proposals will refer to the same resources to be translated.

It is essential to have a coordination layer in order to optimize the funds available and avoid to fund multiple translations of the same content.

A key feature for proposals should be to publish translations in an open-source format, so that each translated resource can be used by others as well. It would be great to have a unique public repo with the output of all funded proposals

# Connection vs Translation

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Connection-vs-Translation/365543-48088)

We should address different languages and regions trying to really connect with the best ways to create a culture of awareness and participation about ADA, cryptos and the blokchain ecosystem from a perspective of Opportunities for them, rather than just only trying to "cold-translate" the available content that exist in english.

ADA, the Catalyst Project, Blockchain and cryptos offer amazing opportunities for non-English speaking communities. We need to make them know! Creating cool awareness!

# Bring Smart Contracts to Vietnam

The English language is still a barrier for a lot of Vietnamese people.

While Learning Smart contracts programming languages is an important key to bring Cardano closer to end-users. The easier learning and deploying are, the more people attract to Cardano's eco-system.

We plan to translate all available fundamental smart contract programming languages courses to Vietnamese, Add more practical examples  and sharing them to local communities/universities.

# Multi-lingual Hybrid Cardano-bot

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Multi-lingual-Hybrid-Cardano-bot/365622-48088)

Translating educational materials will be key, also important is meeting the linguistic needs of those who prefer to/are required to access ideas and the internet via conversational modes of interaction e.g. SMS, WhatsApp, and voice-to-text/text-to-speech. Reducing friction for non-English speakers may include a multi-platform multi-lingual hybrid NLP + MT + human actors chatbot that answers questions, starts conversations, and connects them w Cardano communities in/via non-English languages.

# Translating Blockchain Language

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Translating-Blockchain-Language/365711-48088)

Bridging technical  language barrier for people without computing and software development background. Easy access to translated and localized texts to engage a bigger audience. I had a difficult time understanding cryptocurrency and how it works in the beginning. User friendly language is vital in proposals and contracts. I want to read a white paper and understand it or at least the basics of it.

# A Graphic Cardano Knowledge Corpus

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/A-Graphic-Cardano-Knowledge-Corpus/365723-48088)

The first successful language learning textbook: John Comenius' Orbis Sensualium Pictus (or The World of Things Obvious to the Senses drawn in Pictures) was published in 1658. What if the core ideas and principles of Cardano were represented in a series of connected graphics? The images might do the heavy lifting with multi-lingual captions serving a supporting role. Gather existing graphics, curate and organize, invite Cardano community members to design and contribute, craft captions.

# Expand Cardano resources

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Expand-Cardano-resources/366010-48088)

In my opinion, to make learning resources, it's not just about translate the language,

but we need to find a way to make early adopters to also make effort to understand the resources and talking about this in their own community, i believe we can start from Universities, younger people this day are more risk taker,

in short, why not make competition with rewards that attractive enough for students to make them create resources and spread this, we just provide the platform and basic resources.

# Cardano Romania Community Knowledge

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Romania-Community-Knowledge/365474-48088)

I would like to build the Cardano Romania community through the creation of a more structured knowledge base and repository in Romanian. I have already started glueing together some of the key figures in the local Cardano community on a Discord server.
