## Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

East Asia and Southeast Asia region unites culturally and linguistically diverse countries. People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a poplutation of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions. 

Across East Asia and Southeast Asian regions english is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used [1].

Language barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our engergy, and our pespectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.

### Translation Pipeline and Automation

Our objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start development of localised content. We have already setup a simple translation pipeline[2] using Git, Github, and Crowdin[3] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.

Our initial objective is to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using this system. Gaining experience and building community. 

We will start to embrace and adapt the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[4] to help us. Adapting the processes to accomodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take. 

To get true scale, translations and localisation standards and automation need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano, the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work and to learn and earn. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages NFTs, Native Assets, and Metadata on with Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach.

Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across may groups in Cardano and Catalyst. 
We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusivily. In the Eastern Town Hall we are at the forefront managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practises and automated processes for our own purposes, then share them widely. Everything we learn and do we hope will inform and be informed by Cardano Ecosystem at large.
