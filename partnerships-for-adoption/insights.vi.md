# Partnerships for Global Adoption

ow can Cardano enter in global partnerships with United Nations Development Programme and World Bank Group, to leverage mass adoption?

Fund Size: **$30,000 in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26114) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26114/stage/unspecified).


# S&E measurements integrated

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/S-E-measurements-integrated-with-th/365205-48088)

Developed an S&E (social and environmental) impact evaluation and rating for each proposal/project based on SDG that will connect to international organizations goals and projects.

## Additional Comments

The goal is to match the language of the proposals with the SDG language. We can integrate in the proposal process to explain about SDG and each proposal owner will mark, if relevant, the SDG it is improving. We can then have another layer of approving it by a Cardano SDG community board and give it an SDG rating. Top projects could get priority in funding and support to connect to global organizations.

Once the methodology is in place we can approach global organizations and suggest them to make a challenge the community will approve (this could be actually another proposal)

# World Economic Forum

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/World-Economic-Forum/365229-48088)

The mission of the World Economic Forum is to connect NGOs and IGOs with private industry and communities. I wonder if there is a way that organisation can help build bridges between the Cardano ecosystem and the UNDP.  I don't know anything about this [WEF platform](https://www.weforum.org/platforms/shaping-the-future-of-technology-governance-blockchain-and-distributed-ledger-technologies) but I do see that other crypto companies are members, and I don't see any Cardano representation.

# Unified Hub's

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Unified-Hub-s/365232-48088)

Can unifying organisation's already working on sustainable development goals and introducing them into a decentralised structure to create multiple community hub's be a solution?

Examples of structure

- [Tech stack for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4?fbclid=IwAR3gXMaqnWO9kcL1NK3K8mf0Q0-DBwE4sTRKFFaNRwAJu0w_z1o_nq8TY7I)

Examples of organisations

- [Dent](https://www.dent.global)
- [Icon Fashion Revolution](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/key-organisations/)

# Just DO it.

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Just-DO-it/365794-48088)

If Cardano took the lead creating solutions to implement the 17 UN SDGs using blockchain technology and their creative energy, mass adoption would be a moot point.

Could this challenge be fleshed out more like the [Sustainable Development Goals 2030](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Sustainable-Development-Goals-2030/351795-48088) challenge proposal from Fund 5? Reaching out feels like waiting instead of just doing it.

Wild idea? Collaborate and combine these two proposals into one challenge focused on solving the wicked challenges of climate change now...for the future.

# Enabling Rural India

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Enabling-Rural-India/365921-48088)

I believe that India's 1.3 Billion population has a segment which is disconnected from the adoption process of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We can integrate programs through strategic partnerships with Companies and NGOs that are focusing on environmental, socio-economic growth and provide exposure to people living in suburbs or rural places of the country encouraging maximum participation.

# UNDP Direct Payments

[Insight Link](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/UNDP-Direct-Payments/365982-48088)

The UNDP has issues with its direct payment schemes, as [documented here](https://popp.undp.org/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/UNDP_POPP_DOCUMENT_LIBRARY/Public/FRM_Financial%20Management%20and%20Execution%20Modalities_Direct%20Payments.docx&action=default) ... which may find solutions in the ID-usecase of the cardano blockchain. I suggest to take a closer look at 11., 14. and 15. in assessing the issues ... and potential benefits for UNDP from collaboration with IOHK or EMURGO.
